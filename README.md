        android:layout_height="wrap_content"

        android:textStyle="bold" />           
 ```
 
 ## Java Usage
 ```java
         //Create Object and refer to layout view
         TypeWriterView typeWriterView=(TypeWriterView)findViewById(R.id.typeWriterView);
         
         //Setting each character animation delay
         typeWriterView.setDelay(int);
         
         //Setting music effect On/Off
         typeWriterView.setWithMusic(boolean);
          
         //Animating Text
         typeWriterView.animateText(string);
         
         //Remove Animation. This is required to be called when you want to minimize the app while animation is going on. Call this in onPause() or onStop()
         typeWriterView.removeAnimation();
 ```  
 
 ## Note
 ```
 - The function animateText() when called multiple times on same view, is tweaked to display all the strings concatenated. Use with care, Synchronously.
 - Music effect of typewriter doesn't stop if app is minimized while text is being animated.
